Ideas for the CD 2015 Spring

Copied from Josh

For every time I get passionate. Feel more than welcome to contribute or fork.

We all have stuff that might be cool to actually see working.
Here are a few of mine

## Schedule Manger/Creator
- input all blocks you're in
- select what type of academic cycle you're on (term/semester)
- give time frames for blocks (9-10 for band, etc)
- the app would then add each event for the entire year for each individual class to your Calendar
- Have an alarm for a user defined interval before a class (Really useful for college)
- Notes section for each block (something like a reminder)
- Ablity to sync with multi devices/cross platfrom 

##Homework Databases
- Basically a website that takes answers to worksheets from across the web and puts them in one place
- Seach through documents, catagorized by subject
- Like [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.com/) but more open source
- We must give credit to original answer makers
- Prototype up at [HomeHelp.tk](https://HomeHelp.tk)

## Instant Music Player (without data or local files)
- text [Twilio](twilio.com) number with your song choice
- (probably) Rails server goes and downloads that song (from YouTube or something, convert it to .mp3)
- the number then calls you and plays the song
- supposed to be quick and easy, simple alternative to using stuff like Spotify becuase that requires data

## Instant Phonebook (without data or local files)
- Text [Twilio](twilio.com) with a first and last name or reverse lookup with a phone number
- Twilio server checks Yellow/White Pages for number, if not there it'll check its databases
- Databases contian numbers that've texted it before with certain commands (i.e. "add me - name, surname")

## Cleverbot with Twilio
- As you can probably tell by now I'm obsessed with Twilio
- Make Cleverbot run on Twilio
- That's it

## CLI with [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/)
- This has been done before but I basically just want to improve upon it
- Make simple commands like `forecast local`, `forecast V3A2Z6`, `forecast Vancouver`
- Save all user settings (postal/zip code, city, province/state, country, etc) in `~/.forcast.json` for easy snatchin

## CLI Card game on localhost
- [I've kind of made this already but it's buggy af ](https://github.com/probablyjosh/cards) and it also doesn't work on localhost or support anything other than Blackjack
- Make it better and I'll be your friend a ton

## Tinder for High School
- Essentially Tinder but more location orientated
- when signing up, checks your current location and if it's a school sets that as your school
- only shows people from the school or possibly schools very close in proximity

## Fully Text (SMS) based Twitter
- Text number with Twitter Credentials, and it returns with 10 tweets
- These tweets are ordered and numbered, so the user can reply "2 RT" to retweet the second tweet sent through SMS
- This is already done sort of by Twitter already, but it needs improvement
